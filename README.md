# House-Price-Predicition

I have implemented a Bangalore House Price Prediction model using a Machine Learning algorithm. 
This model predicts the price of Bangalore's house with the help of a few parameters like availability, size, total square feet, bath, location, etc.

 It's a Machine Learning model which integrates Data Science and Web Development. 
 I have deployed the app on the Google Cloud Application Platform.
 
 The Tools used were:
 Anaconda
 Jupyter Notebook
 Pycharm 
 Flask
 Google Cloud Platform
 
 Coding Languages used were:
 Python
 HTML
 Javascript
 CSS
