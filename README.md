# House-Price-Predicition

I have implemented a Bangalore House Price Prediction model using a Machine Learning algorithm. 
This model predicts the price of Bangalore's house with the help of a few parameters like availability, size, total square feet, bath, location, etc.

 It's a Machine Learning model which integrates Data Science and Web Development. 
 I have deployed the app on the Google Cloud Application Platform.
